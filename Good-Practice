Shell Script -> automate daily tasks (Backups, patching, monitor, ...)

###########################################

Name a shell script that make sense. Means that allow yourself and others know exactly what the script does.
Ex.: create a file in linux and give adminn permission. The script name it will be something like create-file-with-admin-permission.sh

.sh extension -> shell script

variable name -> use lower-case and underscores

Run the script -> ALWAYS need to give the rights permissions (chmod +x <file.sh>) then ./file.sh   
               -> bash file.sh
               -> [Run as command] -> create a shell script (without the .sh extension). 
                                          -> This case we need configure in the PATH environment, otherwise it won't work.
                                          -> export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-the-command
                                          -> Then you can run script-as-a-command

VARIABLES - they are case sensitive

usually in the beginning of the script
Ex.:
name_of_valuable=test
ls $name_of_valuable

store the output in a variable within a string to show the value as part of the string
V1=$(V1 $name_of_valuable)
echo "String: $V1"

command as variable -> use ()
up_time=$(uptime)

same variable for backup -> use {}
cp $file ${file}_bkp
