It will run this block if the criteria is match, otherwise the script will skip this block
In case the first statment is not match it will run elif, if is not match it will run else.

if [ $A = "test" ]
then
    debug $A
elif [ $A != "test" ]
then
    echo "well done"
else
    echo "try again"
fi



####   while  ####

while [ xxxx ]
do
  echo "aaaa"
done


while is used when we don't know how many times the block needs to be repeated.
while will be executed as long as the condition is true/occurs
while create infinite loops

related with while/for loop
to escape the block use -> break
to go back to the beginning of the loop use -> continue



#####  case   #####

case <<value/variable>> in
 1) aaa 
    ;;
 2) bbb 
    ;;
 3) break 
    ;;
 *) continue 
    ;;
esac

case statement needs specify the value or a variable that you want to check.
makes the code more simpler and easy and readable than if block
